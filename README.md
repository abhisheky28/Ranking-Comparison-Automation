# Ranking-Comparison-Automation
When you have a list of four competitors to check for rankings, you would
have to manually search each keyword on Google, scroll through pages of results, find each
competitor's website, and note down their position. This is incredibly time-consuming and prone to
errors.
This tool solves that problem.
It is a smart Python script that acts like a digital assistant. It automatically opens a web browser,
searches Google for each of your keywords, finds your competitors' URLs in the search results, and
records their exact ranking (e.g., 1, 5, 25, or "Not Found") directly into your Google Sheet.
It's designed to be robust and human-like, with built-in alerts for security checks (CAPTCHAs) and
script errors, ensuring you are always in control.
